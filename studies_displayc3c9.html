			<div id="studies_txt">The People</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">Now nationally recognised as being at the forefront of school leadership, back in 2004 Andrew Hutchinson was Head of the then ‘Parkside College’ in Cambridge. He set out with a fresh vision to bring local schools into the Parkside fold. Determined to develop Parkside at the heart of the City's learning community, he brought together a two secondary schools and an international 6th form as a unique learning hub for the City.  He pursued a vision to share both the benefits and challenges of serving his learning community through a single organisation structure. As an innovator, he also recognised the importance of schools developing a unique character, and deployed the Government’s Specialist Status programme to help achieve this.</div>
				<div id="studies_txt">The Challenge</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">In support of the wider corporate vision, Andrew asked Jo to help achieve his objective to develop Parkside as a hub for enterprise & the creative industries within the Specialist Status programme, by developing interest and partnerships with the external business community.</div>
			<div id="studies_txt">Our Response</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">KindleCo captured the interest of the City’s business community. Jo deployed Andrew’s commitment to the government’s Specialist Status programme to broker dialogue with external partners who could share the Parkside social & educational mission.</div>
				<div id="studies_txt">The Success</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">Jo brought partnerships worth in excess of £35,000 to table.<br />
10 years on, Schools are now commonly adopting the single- organisation / multi-partner models trail blazed by Andrew Hutchinson at the Parkside Federation. Andrew was awarded the OBE in December 2008 for services to Education.</div>

				<p class="news_title">Autumn 2017 News: Children & Social Work Act -  A Land Of Challenge And Opportunity</p>
				<p class="news_txt">When the Government published 'Putting Children First' in July 2016 (the DfE's Policy paper on Children and Social Work) there was considerable doubt in the sector as to the Bill's likely success, and what changes it would bring as an Act.  <br />
Key to predicting with relative certainty the outcome, was taking a careful look at its antecedents in Policy terms over the past 3-5 years: the Children & Families, Devolution, Education & Adoption Acts, and a new LA remit for Public Health. <br />
<br />
Armed with a small splash of wisdom born out of experience, it became clear to those of us with a track record of interpreting Public Policy announcements, that the Bill would indeed go through and at a relatively fast pace....<br />
<br />
Royal Assent was granted just as Parliament closed in April ’17, for the General Election and most key elements from 'Putting Children First' made it onto the statute books.  You can read my earlier predictions on this, by clicking through this News article. <br />
But where are we now?<br />

Read on for my quick fire overview. Enjoy!</p>

								<p class="news_title">Emotional Health & Mental Wellbeing: Vulnerable Children, Their Families And Professional Supporters - Reflective Spaces</p>
				<p class="news_txt">When the Government's new guidance to promote Health & Wellbeing of Looked After Children was published back in 2015, it rightly promoted integrated agency working. <br />
<br />
But what about the Health & Wellbeing of the adults involved in supporting vulnerable children, Looked After, or not?  <br />
<br />
There is an army out there of parents, carers, schools staff, public sector workers, and volunteers all engaging with vulnerable Children and Young People. <br />
<br />
How can their wellbeing also be supported so they can process the emotional impact of this work and  'stay whole'?....</p>
