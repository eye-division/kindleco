Key shifts at national level, in the Children & Families Act, the arrival of Health & Wellbeing Boards, and the advent of Future in Mind, provide both challenge and opportunity to its charitable mission......<br />

			<p class="news_title">Autumn 2017 News: Children & Social Work Act -  A Land Of Challenge And Opportunity</p>
			<p class="news_txt">When the Government published 'Putting Children First' in July 2016 (the DfE's Policy paper on Children and Social Work) there was considerable doubt in the sector as to the Bill's likely success, and what changes it would bring as an Act.  <br />
Key to predicting with relative certainty the outcome, was taking a careful look at its antecedents in Policy terms over the past 3-5 years: the Children & Families, Devolution, Education & Adoption Acts, and a new LA remit for Public Health. <br />
<br />
Armed with a small splash of wisdom born out of experience, it became clear to those of us with a track record of interpreting Public Policy announcements, that the Bill would indeed go through and at a relatively fast pace....<br />
<br />
Royal Assent was granted just as Parliament closed in April ’17, for the General Election and most key elements from 'Putting Children First' made it onto the statute books.  You can read my earlier predictions on this, by clicking through this News article. <br />
But where are we now?<br />
<br />
Read on for my quick fire overview. Enjoy!</p>

							<p class="news_title">Emotional Health & Mental Wellbeing: Vulnerable Children, Their Families And Professional Supporters - Reflective Spaces</p>
			<p class="news_txt">When the Government's new guidance to promote Health & Wellbeing of Looked After Children was published back in 2015, it rightly promoted integrated agency working. <br />
<br />
But what about the Health & Wellbeing of the adults involved in supporting vulnerable children, Looked After, or not?  <br />
<br />
There is an army out there of parents, carers, schools staff, public sector workers, and volunteers all engaging with vulnerable Children and Young People. <br />
<br />
How can their wellbeing also be supported so they can process the emotional impact of this work and  'stay whole'?....</p>
