	<div id="studies_txt">AIRPORT INNOVATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OUT OF WORK</div>
			<div id="studies_txt">The People</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">Immediately prior to establishing Kindle, Jo Broad was responsible for Learning & Skills at Arts Council England in the East England region. Jo brought together a range of partners including the East England Development Agency, Arts Council England, the Goverment's Skills for Life programme, BAA Stansted and two Learning & Skills Councils to collaborate on finding new ways to support young unemployed people into work.</div>
				<div id="studies_txt">The Challenge</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">We set out to forge a link between the agendas of different government agencies and a major regional employer to enable collaborative action on regional workforce skills to further the employment prospects of young people.</div>
			<div id="studies_txt">The Response</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">Jo brokered a partnership with BAA's Stansted Airport and a range of agencies supporting young people and adults. A joint objective was agreed of increasing recruitment and employment at the Airport of young people & young adults disadvantaged in the job market due to poor key skills. Jo brought together five diverse organisations and associated funding streams. The expertise & resources of different organisations were pooled and an innovative training tool using the Arts was established within the Airport Skills Programme. Using the Arts as a delivery mechanism, the training was fun for participants, had measurable learning outcomes and was bespoke to the employer.</div>
				<div id="studies_txt">The Success</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">The BAA partnership project helped strengthen the ‘innovation’ branding of the Airport Skills Programme and was reported by BAA to have approximately 40 % improved success in recruiting young trainees to the point of job placement. The project provided an exchange of skills between mainstream and niche arts-based training providers.  The project was subsequently promoted by BAA Stansted to its sister airports at Heathrow and Gatwick.</div>

				<p class="news_title">Autumn 2017 News: Children & Social Work Act -  A Land Of Challenge And Opportunity</p>
				<p class="news_txt">When the Government published 'Putting Children First' in July 2016 (the DfE's Policy paper on Children and Social Work) there was considerable doubt in the sector as to the Bill's likely success, and what changes it would bring as an Act.  <br />
Key to predicting with relative certainty the outcome, was taking a careful look at its antecedents in Policy terms over the past 3-5 years: the Children & Families, Devolution, Education & Adoption Acts, and a new LA remit for Public Health. <br />
<br />
Armed with a small splash of wisdom born out of experience, it became clear to those of us with a track record of interpreting Public Policy announcements, that the Bill would indeed go through and at a relatively fast pace....<br />
<br />
Royal Assent was granted just as Parliament closed in April ’17, for the General Election and most key elements from 'Putting Children First' made it onto the statute books.  You can read my earlier predictions on this, by clicking through this News article. <br />
But where are we now?<br />

Read on for my quick fire overview. Enjoy!</p>

								<p class="news_title">Emotional Health & Mental Wellbeing: Vulnerable Children, Their Families And Professional Supporters - Reflective Spaces</p>
				<p class="news_txt">When the Government's new guidance to promote Health & Wellbeing of Looked After Children was published back in 2015, it rightly promoted integrated agency working. <br />
<br />
But what about the Health & Wellbeing of the adults involved in supporting vulnerable children, Looked After, or not?  <br />
<br />
There is an army out there of parents, carers, schools staff, public sector workers, and volunteers all engaging with vulnerable Children and Young People. <br />
<br />
How can their wellbeing also be supported so they can process the emotional impact of this work and  'stay whole'?....</p>
