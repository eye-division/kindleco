			<div id="studies_txt">The People</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">Improving the life outcomes for traumatised and vulnerable children is the mission of the Mulberry Bush Organisation based in Oxfordshire. <br />
<br />
For those organisations who need and want to work in close partnership with the Public Sector, policy and system change at national level can heavily impact an organisation’s work, as well as that of their customers, partners and stakeholders. <br />
<br />
The potential to feel simultaneously corporately excited, overwhelmed and challenged, becomes a regular occurrence for many operating in the Public Sector eco-system. <br />
<br />
Jo has been working with MBO as a specialist Associate since September 2013 to help support MBO's response the changing national policy and strategic landscape, from the Children & Families Act 2014, to Health & Wellbeing, Putting Children First and more.</div>
				<div id="studies_txt">The Challenge</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">To assist senior leadership in achieving its objective, to lead the organisation to a response to the Children & Families Act, Health & Wellbeing, Putting Children First and other key shifts at national level impacting the sectors supporting vulnerable children & families. <br />
<br />
The response needed to be bespoke, support their charitable mission, further the corporate objectives for the whole-organisation, be strategic and be practical.</div>
			<div id="studies_txt">The Response</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">Formed an evidence-based analysis of specific opportunities and risks arising from external changes in sector; developed a strategy to embrace these as a whole-organisation; produced set of prioritised 'next-steps' for each  major change;  identified opportunities for business development, strategic partnerships and growing MBO’s sphere of influence; working in partnership with key organisational Leaders to achieve this.</div>
				<div id="studies_txt">The Success</div>
      <div id="studybody_txt">"Jo was able to demonstrate quickly her skills in capturing our ‘organisational essence’, demonstrating a sound understanding of our corporate dynamics. Combining this with strong strategic skills and an experienced grasp of public sector dynamics, she enabled us to arrive at an informed view of what the Children & Families Act and other national developments mean for us whole-organisation”.....</div>

				<p class="news_title">Autumn 2017 News: Children & Social Work Act -  A Land Of Challenge And Opportunity</p>
				<p class="news_txt">When the Government published 'Putting Children First' in July 2016 (the DfE's Policy paper on Children and Social Work) there was considerable doubt in the sector as to the Bill's likely success, and what changes it would bring as an Act.  <br />
Key to predicting with relative certainty the outcome, was taking a careful look at its antecedents in Policy terms over the past 3-5 years: the Children & Families, Devolution, Education & Adoption Acts, and a new LA remit for Public Health. <br />
<br />
Armed with a small splash of wisdom born out of experience, it became clear to those of us with a track record of interpreting Public Policy announcements, that the Bill would indeed go through and at a relatively fast pace....<br />
<br />
Royal Assent was granted just as Parliament closed in April ’17, for the General Election and most key elements from 'Putting Children First' made it onto the statute books.  You can read my earlier predictions on this, by clicking through this News article. <br />
But where are we now?<br />
<br />
Read on for my quick fire overview. Enjoy!</p>

								<p class="news_title">Emotional Health & Mental Wellbeing: Vulnerable Children, Their Families And Professional Supporters - Reflective Spaces</p>
				<p class="news_txt">When the Government's new guidance to promote Health & Wellbeing of Looked After Children was published back in 2015, it rightly promoted integrated agency working. <br />
<br />
But what about the Health & Wellbeing of the adults involved in supporting vulnerable children, Looked After, or not?  <br />
<br />
There is an army out there of parents, carers, schools staff, public sector workers, and volunteers all engaging with vulnerable Children and Young People. <br />
<br />
How can their wellbeing also be supported so they can process the emotional impact of this work and  'stay whole'?....</p>
